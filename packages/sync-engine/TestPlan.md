# Test Plan — `@rozek/sds-sync-engine`

---

## Goal

Verify that `SDS_SyncEngine` correctly coordinates `SDS_DataStore` with persistence, network, and presence providers across its full lifecycle.

---

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Construction with optional providers and lifecycle (`start()` / `stop()`)
- Local restore from persisted snapshot and patches on `start()`
- Outgoing patch persistence (`appendPatch`) and network send (`sendPatch`)
- Checkpoint trigger when accumulated patch bytes exceed the 512 KiB threshold
- Incoming network patch application to the store
- Offline queue flush on reconnect
- `connectTo()` / `reconnect()` error handling
- Presence broadcast (`setPresenceTo`) and incoming remote state
- `onPresenceChange` handler registration and peer timeout

**Out of scope:**
- Real network connections (unit tests use mocks)
- BroadcastChannel (browser-only; tested separately in integration)

---

## Test Environment

- **Runtime:** Node.js 22+
- **Mocks:** Vitest mock functions for all providers
- **Test framework:** Vitest 2

---

## Part I — Lifecycle

### 1. Construction and start/stop

#### 1.1 Basic construction

- **TC-1.1.1** — Constructing `SDS_SyncEngine` without any options succeeds, and `PeerId` is a non-empty string

#### 1.2 Start with no providers

- **TC-1.2.1** — `start()` with no persistence or network provider resolves without throwing

#### 1.3 Stop calls provider teardown

- **TC-1.3.1** — After `start()` and `stop()`, `persistence.close()` and `network.disconnect()` have each been called exactly once

#### 1.4 Stop with accumulated changes

- **TC-1.4.1** — After making a store change and calling `stop()`, `persistence.close()` is called (stop-time checkpoint completes without error)

---

## Part II — Persistence

### 1. Restore on start

#### 1.1 Patch replay from persistence

- **TC-2.1.1** — `start()` calls `loadPatchesSince` and applies the returned patches to the store, making previously created items accessible by Id and label

### 2. Outgoing patch recording

#### 2.1 Append on store change

- **TC-2.2.1** — A store change after `start()` causes `appendPatch` to be called once with a non-empty `Uint8Array` payload and a positive monotonically increasing clock value

### 3. Checkpoint on threshold

#### 3.1 In-flight checkpoint

- **TC-3.1.1** — Accumulating more than 512 KiB of patch data triggers `saveSnapshot` and `prunePatches` without waiting for `stop()`

### 4. Stop-time checkpoint

#### 4.1 Checkpoint on stop

- **TC-4.1.1** — After a small store change (below the in-flight threshold), `stop()` triggers `saveSnapshot`, `prunePatches`, and `close()`

---

## Part III — Network

### 1. Error handling

#### 1.1 connectTo without provider

- **TC-3.1.1** — `connectTo()` when no `NetworkProvider` is configured rejects with an `SDS_Error` whose `Code` is `'no-network-provider'`

#### 1.2 Reconnect without prior connect

- **TC-3.2.1** — `reconnect()` before any successful `connectTo()` rejects with an `SDS_Error` whose `Code` is `'not-yet-connected'`

### 2. Outgoing patch dispatch

#### 2.1 Send when connected

- **TC-3.3.1** — When the network connection state transitions to `'connected'`, a subsequent store change causes `network.sendPatch` to be called

#### 2.2 Offline queue flush

- **TC-3.4.1** — A store change made while disconnected does not call `sendPatch`; once the connection transitions to `'connected'`, the queued patch is flushed and `sendPatch` is called exactly once

### 3. Incoming patch application

#### 3.1 Remote patch applied to store

- **TC-3.5.1** — An incoming network patch delivered via the `onPatch` callback is applied to the store, making the patched data's label readable

---

## Part IV — Presence

### 1. Outgoing presence

#### 1.1 Local state broadcast

- **TC-4.1.1** — `setPresenceTo(state)` calls `presence.sendLocalState` with the exact same state object
- **TC-4.1.2** — `setPresenceTo({ custom: {...} })` passes the `custom` field through to `presence.sendLocalState`

#### 1.2 Local presence change event

- **TC-4.2.1** — `setPresenceTo(state)` causes every registered `onPresenceChange` handler to be called with the engine's own `PeerId`, the state, and the string `'local'`

### 2. Incoming presence

#### 2.1 Remote presence change event

- **TC-4.3.1** — An incoming remote state delivered via `onRemoteState` causes every registered `onPresenceChange` handler to be called with the remote peer Id, the state, and the string `'remote'`

#### 2.2 Peer timeout

- **TC-4.4.1** — After a remote peer's state is received and the configured `PresenceTimeoutMs` elapses without a refresh, `onPresenceChange` is called with the peer Id and `undefined` state, signalling departure
